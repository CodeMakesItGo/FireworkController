# FireworkController
Programmable firework firing system with remote control

This project is using the Arduino Nano and WS2811 LEDs for a 50 channel (cues) remote firework firing system. 

One of the best features of this system is that you can visually test the program's output before connecting it to any fireworks by watching the LEDs light up.

Total cost was $98.84
